# A frontend deployed on Google Compute Engine Traffic Sign Classification

- it only works with non-chrome browser as it needs to use the camera over http (not https).
- it is a quick and dirty way for me to test my models from [Udacity SDC course](https://github.com/udacity/traffic-signs). So my apology if the code looks ugly. 
- you can deploy it on any host, e.g. [GCP](https://cloud.google.com), AWS or [cloud9.io](https://c9.io/). I am using google compute engine with anancoda3 installed.
