## Usage
- Tested with 
  - firefox on Anroid
  - Chrome on desktop

## Notes:
- Cache of static files on GAE gave me a lot of headaches, not really sure how to get rid of it
- In development phase, I just embed all js in the html template, not sure if I should put them in a separate template or static file?

## TODO:
- connect it to drone
